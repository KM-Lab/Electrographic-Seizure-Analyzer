%10/13/2018  - Change in "findallofthem.m"
%In line 697 there was a reference to a nonexistent variable "Settings" which should have been "Info.Settings".
%This error did not negatively impact correct running of the code in the old version. However, it did result in 
%an error at the matlab command prompt, and resulted in a file sometimes unneccessarily being overwritten with the same data.
